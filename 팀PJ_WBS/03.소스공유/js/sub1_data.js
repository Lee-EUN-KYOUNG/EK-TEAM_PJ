      Toy Story answers that question with a fantastic fun-filled journey, <br> viewed mostly through the eyes of two rival toys - Woody, the lanky, likable cowboy, and Buzz Lightyear, the fearless space ranger. <br> Led by Woody, Andy's toys live happily in his room until Andy's birthday brings Buzz Lightyear onto the scene. <br> Afraid of losing his place in Andy's heart, Woody plots against Buzz. <br>
      But when circumstances separate Buzz and Woody from their owner,
      the comically-mismatched duo eventually learn to put aside their differences, <br> and they find themselves on a hilarious adventure-filled mission where the only way they can survive is to form an uneasy alliance.`,

      But for the story to work, the two main characters needed to have their own chemistry.
      Early versions of Woody included a ventriloquist's dummy and an ill-tempered cowboy before he became the affable hero seen on screen. Buzz Lightyear offered a different challenge: inventing a brand-new toy that instantly felt familiar.`,
